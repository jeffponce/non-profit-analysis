The goal of this project is to better understand US Non-profit organizations and how they perform when compared to each other on based on income, revenue, and assets. Furthermore, we will look at the Top 10 Non-profits in the regions and the Top 10 per state.

We will analysis the data, isolate the info needed, and export data to be visualized in Tableau.
